I'm a solution-oriented Front-end Developer, lifelong learner, and adventurer with a professional background in Software Engineering. I enjoy development because of the satisfaction I get by overcoming changes. I have an Engineer mindset. Frameworks and languages are tools for me. What matters is that the problem is solved more cleanly and conveniently. Connect with me to discuss how I can help you or your organization!
